## Fight Hate. One step at a Time.

## What is the Resistance Toolkit?
Are you feeling as overwhelmed and ready to shut down as I am in the wake of all of the hatred being unleashed by politicians? 

Feeling hopeless, I realized I needed a way to channel my frustration into meaningful action. So I am developing the Resistance Toolkit in an attempt to turn outrage into progress. The mission is to create a process: pick a cause, take an action, recover, and repeat. This seemed more achievable to me then attempting to somehow tackle all of the issues at once.

I know that together, we can transform feelings of hopelessness into a movement for change. Let's build something that fights hate, one action at a time.


## How To Help Develop This Project
**_Please read the [Contributing doc](./CONTRIBUTING.md)_** to see the types of issues and requests that are currently being accepted.

## Why On GitHub?
I chose to host this MVP (minimal viable product) version of The Resistance Toolkit on GitHub for a couple of reasons:

1. **Open Source:** It's important to me that this project is open sourced. The goal is to foster a community of passionate and active people to help develop and maintain this project. 

2. **Rapid Development:** Things are changing at an incredible pace. It seems like everyday there is a new executive order and a new cause under threat. I want to be able to be nimble and test out new strategies.
