# Security Policy
Thank you for making the Resistance Toolkit a safe project for everyone.

When linking to organizations and tools in this project, I strive to do my due deligance in vetting them. 
However, because the topics and causes are so broad it is difficult to be 100% sure. 

I need your help in vetting process. If you see a tool, organization, or link that you 
believe might cause a security risk to users, please notify me!
