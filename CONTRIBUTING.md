## Welcome
Have suggestions, comments, concerns? Or maybe you have a new feature idea you'd like to see added? I want this repo to be as helpful as possible, so thank you for your assistance in making the Resistance Toolkit relevant and useful.

This is a WIP, please check back periodically as I will be updating this document frequently! 

# What types of contributions can you make?
My goal is to ensure all content in this repository is accurate, up to date, and is representative of the mission to provide tools to resist hatred. The following are the types of contributions that will be accepted. 

**Types of issues that will be accepted**
- [Harmful Content](#harmful-content)
- [Suggest an Organization or Cause](#suggest-an-organization-or-cause)
- [Enhancement](#enhancement)
- [Spelling & Grammar](#spelling--grammar)
- [Discussions](#discussions)

## Harmful Content
Create an issue with the `harmful content` label. Please be specific about the content in question and provide an explanation and/or evidence to support your claim.


__I will not__ accept personal opinions as a reason for removal of content. Please back up your claim with real proof (an article from a reputable news agency, a scientific paper, a law suit, etc).


Examples of harmful content: 
- A featured organization has been found to be fraudulent, misleading, or spreading hate.
- Suggestion or information listed that is in fact either harmful or not effective.

## Suggest an Organization or Cause
Create an issue with the `organization suggestion` label. Please provide a link to the organization, a category that falls under, and a quick description or mission statement. 

## Enhancement
Is there a feature you'd like to see created or added to the Resistance Toolkit? Create an issue with the `enhancement` label. I will add accepted enhancement requests to the development roadmap. 

## Spelling & Grammar
I am notoriously horrible at spelling... auto-correct is just about the only way I survive. Please use the `spelling / grammar` label to make spelling corrections or suggestions on better grammatical syntax. 

## Discussions
I would love to foster a community of people who are motivated, passionate, and engaged in resisting hate and improving this toolkit. Discussions on **_relevant_** topics about this project are encouraged using the `discussion` label. 

**Examples of Relevant Topics Might Be**
- How to promote this tool
- Effectiveness of the tool
- Discussions on the development roadmap

**Examples of Topics That Are NOT Relevant**
- News stories / Memes (post these to your organization's social media pages)
- Your opinions on organizations or causes (If you think an org is harmful, open a [Harmful Content Issue](#harmful-content))
- Personal stories about how an issue is 

# Contributions I am not looking for.
